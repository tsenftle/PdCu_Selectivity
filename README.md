# PdCu_Selectivity

This folder includes the key files and converged structure for the DFT calculation in the paper: PdCu Electrocatalysts for Selective Nitrate and Nitrite Reduction to Nitrogen
https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.2c04841
The initial state (IS), transtion state (TS), and final state (FS) of the reaction is shown for each key reaction. The frequency analysis of the TS is shown in folder "freq" and the vibrational frequency result is in the file "freq".
